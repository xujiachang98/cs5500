# Use Case 3

<hr>

**Use Case**: Canvas clearance

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: Clear the entire canvas and fill the entire canvas with the last selected color

**Preconditions**: The window and canvas are opened and running, one color is selected and there are pixels in the canvas

**Trigger**: Pressing the space key
  
**Scenario**: A user will press the space key in the keyboard to clear the canvas
 
**Exceptions**: The program may become potentially unresponsive. May need to wait a few seconds to clear the canvas

**Priority**: Medium

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: The primary actor communicates through I/O devices using the keyboard. The user is responsible for all other input.

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We may need to implement 'saving' functionality in the future before clear everything.
